* Use axum to create a simple demo app
* GET /hello should return "hello, world", and GET /hello/\<name\> should return "hello, \<name\>" (with \<name\> substituted by the given name ofc)
* cargo run should run the server on localhost:3000
* commit to a git repo where I also have write access (so I can add tests)
* don't make it more complicated than this (don't add features)
